# Classification of Polluted Silicone Rubber Insulators by Using LIBS Assisted Machine Learning Techniques

## Overview

This repository contains the code for the paper titled "Classification of Polluted Silicone Rubber Insulators by Using LIBS Assisted Machine Learning Techniques." The paper explores the identification and classification of silicone rubber (SR) samples coated with various artificially prepared pollutants using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and machine learning techniques.

## Abstract

Silicone rubber (SR) samples are coated with various types of artificially prepared pollutants, aiming to identify and distinguish them using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). LIBS analysis successfully identifies the elemental composition of different pollutants. The presence of copper sulfate, carbon-based compounds (such as fly ash, coal), and calcium-based compounds (such as cement and calcium phosphate fertilizer) is identified by the increment in the normalized intensity ratio of copper, carbon, and calcium peaks, respectively. LIBS spectral data, combined with machine learning (ML) algorithms like linear discriminant analysis, decision tree, K-nearest neighbors, and various gradient boosting techniques, is employed to classify seven different types of contaminated SR samples. In comparison to other ML approaches in the study, the Light Gradient Boosting technique achieves a superior classification accuracy of 97.43% with a reasonable computation time of 5.1 seconds.
